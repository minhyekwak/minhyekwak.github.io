            <p>"Stage" was the first word that I heard in this morning when I played the documentary film "Citizen Four."</p>

                <h3>Stage !== Slope</h3>
                <p>Stage has a meaning of a point, period, or step in a process or development (New Oxford American Dictionary). It represents a certain level of process, not the process itself. I saw slope has the most opposite meaning of stage. When we say somebody is walking up on the slope, that means he or she keeps moving forward, not staying in a certain spot. However, at the same time, that move can be also interpreted as he or she is passing countless stages.</p>
                <h3>Theme: My Journey of Learning</h3>
                <p>Even it has been only four weeks since I started DT, I got through whirlwinds as many as I can bear during this time. Some stages were easier than others, some were much more horrible than I imagined. But the good thing is, I am learning a lot more than I imagined. It is absolute that I am climbing the most steep slope that I never had, but I feel happy that I am in the progress. I don't know how many stages are left in the future, how firm will each stages be, how long will each stages take. What I know is enjoying each stages is the best answer no matter what. </p>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>To apply my interpretation of stage/slope, I decided to try C++, using openFrameworks for creative coding. Based on stripe patterns, stages and slope are expressed and gui sliders are added to adjust stages' number, gap, and width. Audience can adjust the each level and sense a bit of what God feels when he/she is molding immortals' lives. Would it be better if we can adjust the level of our life stages less or more, soon or later, and stabile or adventurous? If we could, it would be no longer "life."<br>References: <a href="http://openframeworks.cc" target="_blank">http://openframeworks.cc</a>, <i>openFrameworks Essentials</i>, Denis Perevalov and Igor Tatarnikov, Packt Publishing</p>
