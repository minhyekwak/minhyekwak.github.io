                    <h3>South Korean domestic political situation</h3>
                    <p>Recently South Korea has been through complicated political events. Former president, Park Geun-Hye, was accused by bribe and abuse of authority so that she was impeached last year. President Park was a symbolic person who represent conservative, corrupted, and dictatorial old generation. The new president has been elected on May 2017, President Moon Jae-In, and he is admired and supported by the majority of people of South Korea for his integrity and devotion to the weak. This series of events which contain fall and rise of government is evaluated as achievement of South Korean people who had been continously fighting for upright government. We call it "Candle Revolution." </p>
