                    <p>Two opposite meanings  are in one word.<br/><br/>ex) Purpose_ She swims everyday so that she can stay healthy. (source : YBM)<br/><br/>ex) Result_ He stands his friend up so that he have no friends. (source : YBM)<br/><br/>Paradox and irony could be found in this phrase.</p>
                    <h3>Progress: Start = End</h3>
                    <p>This artwork aims to express the conception which started from the attribute of the phrase, "so that." The phrase has already two opposite meaning, purpose and result. Purpose is used before the main event starts, and result usually happens in the last minute of the event. The conception has improved by the idea that start and end are not different, moreover they are in the same position.</p>
