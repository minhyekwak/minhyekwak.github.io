                    <p>Recently South Korea has been through complicated political events. Former president, Park Geun-Hye, was accused by bribe and abuse of authority so that she was impeached last year. President Park was a symbolic person who represent conservative, corrupted, and dictatorial old generation. The new president has been elected on May 2017, President Moon Jae-In, and he is admired and supported by the majority of people of South Korea for his integrity and devotion to the weak. This series of events which contain fall and rise of government is evaluated as achievement of South Korean people who had been continously fighting for upright government. We call it "Candle Revolution." </p>

                    <p>Description_ Game board represents South Korean map including 8 regions. Each region has 17 engraved circles so that chips can be put on those circles.Chips are separated as red(President Park), blue(President Moon), and yellow(double-value, candle revolution). Cards as well, separated by 3 colors, containing the different number of each President.</p>
                    <p>How to Play_ Each players are assigned their regions by flipping a coin/rock, paper, scissors. Cards are piled up and nobody can see how many each president are there. Players, one by one, pick a card, check the number of each president, and put chips according to the card they picked. When all of circles are filled, the game is over. The winner is the one who has the highest number of blue chips. The yellow one count as two blue chips.</p>

            <h2>Day 4&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>stage</span></h2>
            <p>"Stage" was the first word that I heard in this morning when I played the documentary film "Citizen Four."</p>
            <div class="day4-desc">
                <h3>Stage !== Slope</h3>
                <p>Stage has a meaning of a point, period, or step in a process or development (New Oxford American Dictionary). It represents a certain level of process, not the process itself. I saw slope has the most opposite meaning of stage. When we say somebody is walking up on the slope, that means he or she keeps moving forward, not staying in a certain spot. However, at the same time, that move can be also interpreted as he or she is passing countless stages.</p>
                <h3>Theme: My Journey of Learning</h3>
                <p>Even it has been only four weeks since I started DT, I got through whirlwinds as many as I can bear during this time. Some stages were easier than others, some were much more horrible than I imagined. But the good thing is, I am learning a lot more than I imagined. It is absolute that I am climbing the most steep slope that I never had, but I feel happy that I am in the progress. I don't know how many stages are left in the future, how firm will each stages be, how long will each stages take. What I know is enjoying each stages is the best answer no matter what. </p>
                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>To apply my interpretation of stage/slope, I decided to try C++, using openFrameworks for creative coding. Based on stripe patterns, stages and slope are expressed and gui sliders are added to adjust stages' number, gap, and width. Audience can adjust the each level and sense a bit of what God feels when he/she is molding immortals' lives. Would it be better if we can adjust the level of our life stages less or more, soon or later, and stabile or adventurous? If we could, it would be no longer "life."<br>References: <a href="http://openframeworks.cc" target="_blank">http://openframeworks.cc</a>, <i>openFrameworks Essentials</i>, Denis Perevalov and Igor Tatarnikov, Packt Publishing</p>

            <h2>Day 5&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>nothing</span></h2>
            <p>The first word I heard this morning was "nothing" from Calvin Harris' song, <i>Feels</i>, which was the top 1 song of the dance music chart of Apple Music. </p>
            <div class="day5-desc">
                <h3>The World with Numerous Invisible Sensors</h3>
                <p>Today's word was "Nothing." I suppose the world of no medium, in which every fuctions drive by invisibly installed numerous sensors. In that future world, there is no devices or physical triggers that user can handle directly, but countless sensors spread everywhere we go. Those sensors are planned and designed in details, so they can predict each users' behavior, patterns, even taste. </p>
                
                <h3>Initial Idea : Smart Studio with Optimized Lighting</h3>
                <p>Even if we are in one single space, we need different kind of light according to the patterns/usage. For instance, imagine we are living in the studio. We want a comfortable yellow light when we are in bed, and we want a bright white light when we are in desk focusing on work/study. I would like to create smart sensor light which offers optimized kind of lighting according to the user's location.</p>

                    <p>I decided to make a miniature sensor light using Arduino. Including self study for Arduino led fade in/out exercise, I start to expand how I can materialize my idea.</p>

                    <p>This smart light used Ultrasonic sensor so it could easily catch human existence, and its sensitivity also can be adjustable according to the distance between human and sensor. I set different codes to each light so that they could output light depending on the location of users.</p>

                <h3>Protest Art</h3>
                <p>Like everybody knows, North Korea and nuclear program became to the most common topic for all the people around the world. Somebody would just neglect or somebody would get terrified. As a designer and artist, we could raise our voice by our own medium. I decided to make a "Protest Art," and explore historical precedences.</p>
                <h3>Precedences: Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat</h3>
                <p>I found two creative protest artist, Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat. They were both fighting with inequity of gender, race, and status using their art. They both used very bold color to make their position vividly. There can be found a sense of humor and sarcasm, a satire, and full of honesty.</p>
                <img src="image/ms1-02-7in7/protest-art.jpg">
                <p class="caption">Image source: www.indexsocial.info, creators.vice.com, news.artnet.com, www.wikiart.org</p>
                <h3>Procedure</h3>
                <p>I decided to make this artwork for protesting against nuclear weapon. I would like put some sarcasm and satire like other protest artist, therefore I chose the way to make "mockery" on this symbolic person, Kim Jung Un through my work. I found many funny images of him from internet, and also put President Trump's image who is in opposition to him.</p>
                <h3>Artwork</h3>
                <p>I chose to express my hommage to Andy Warhol, whose art could be the perfect fit to express sarcasm.<br>Future iteration : This can be used as a picket when the demonstration actually happens, or it can be applied to graffiti art so that the message will be spread whoever passed by.</p>
