                <p>The idea of this artwork is derived from awareness of the magnitude of most women's emotional problem. Depression, mood swing, irritability, and anxiety have significant seriousness that cannot be neglected such as "just because of hormones." This phenomenon definitely needs proven cure methods, and art and design area has the same reponsibility, as well.<br><br>
                Thus, this artwork was created to give the feeling of unity to suffering women. Each folded colored paper symbolize suffering, up-and-down, trouble, depression, and whatever they are getting through. But when each piece of papers are connected to others, they become more tolerable, and even become a beautiful art. </p>
                <div class="img-2">
                    <img src="image/ms1-03/2d-2.jpg">
                </div>
                <p>Audience can participate to make this art pulling out a piece of paper and linking the last audience's piece. Actually this artwork is produced by audience. There is no end until the all papers in the world will be run out. Originally this art is planned to set in a whole walls of a room. <br><br>
                Each different shape is totally up to the each audience. They can be short or long, curvy or flat, smooth or twisted by flexibility of folded paper. When the audience link their trouble to others, they could feel more secure, comfortable than before. "I'm not alone."</p>
