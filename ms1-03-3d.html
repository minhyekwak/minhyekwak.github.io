                <p>This project started in order to illustrate the desperate needs of pills. The assumption rose up: what if there is only one PMS pill exist? This assumption was developed into the level that I imagined an apocalyptic situation. Due to nuclear war, most of human being was demolished and a few minor tribes are survived. There is no more medical company to produce any pills, and finally only one pill has left.<br>What the hxxx situation is this?<br><br>
                My scenario is quite positive. I believe the strength of womenhood. The women community decided to make this one pill sealed, unreachable to everyone. It will be preserved in beautifully designed copper-shine storage product, but the 7 sides of this product are covered with meshed copper so that the pill inside can be visible. They decided to make this storage as a sacred place for the pill. Any women who are experiencing painful emotion or trouble, can gathered around here and see the pill through the mesh. It's like a ritual to get healed from this mental disease. </p>

                <p>Looking has a power. There is a old Korean traditional custom, which was for the old generation who has no money, nothing to eat. They bought one fish and hung it on the ceiling. During their meal time, they could have the eating-the-fish effect with just looking the fish even if they were having only rice. And they continued to do that in every meal. I also tried to give an aesthetic sense of some spirituality of primitive times. </p>
