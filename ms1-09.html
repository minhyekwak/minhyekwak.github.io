            <div class="proposal">
                <p><b>Dreams: Beyond Time and Space</b><br>	
There is an interesting description of a dream in Marcel Proust’s monumental novel, In Search of Lost Time. The depiction starts with this sentence: “When a man is asleep, he holds in a circle around him the chain of the hours, the sequence of the years, and the order of universe.”<span class="cite">[1]</span> In a world of dreams, time and space keep expanding and shrinking around people, and they can encounter numerous unexpected scenes of past, present, and future. There might be tears, laughter, and inspiration. At the same time, they are healed from mental traumas and given the insights for the future. For this design project, I would like to explore the mystery of dreams in order to reveal the idea of how they are generated according to the mechanism of universe.</p>
                <p><b>Effects of Dreams</b><br>
It is not academically proved yet how dreams are made and where they come from. Some distinguished scholars like Freud highlighted the significance of dreams in psychological way. However, there are still many questions about dreams that Freud or Carl Jung's theories could not give answers. Those are some vivid dreams that leave strong impressions like healing from mental traumas, getting a sense from current situations, receiving wisdom and insights for the near future. Some might argue that not all dreams give those effects, but certain dreams are so perfect as they are that there is no need of psychoanalysis or interpretation. As soon as these dreams are experienced, they are complete and the profound meaning is realized by dreamers immediately.</p>
                <p><b>Assumptions: How Dreams are Generated</b><br>
There is an interesting research on the connection between the human brain and the universe. Mark Miller, a neuroscientist of Brandeis University, discovered that human brain cells are similar to a large cluster of galaxies. Furthermore, human brain shows even more complexity than galaxies. There are 100 billion stars in the Milky Way, but over a trillion neurons and gliocytes are in one human brain. According to fractal cosmology, which has developed from Leibniz’s Monadology in the 17th century, even the smallest particle that constitutes human could be the infinite universe of tiny, invisible other species, and the universe we are belong to could be also a brain of one gigantic being.<span class="cite">[2]</span> This assumption that we have a similar brain to this gigantic being can be supported by Bible, which says the Creator made mankind in his image.<span class="cite">[3]</span> In that sense of fractal cosmology, in our unconsciousness, it is possible that we transcend our scale of time and space. Another cosmology called “the fractal-holographic universe” insists that singularity, also as known as a black hole, is no longer a pit hole devouring everything, rather it is a perfect balance of nothingness creating infinite data constantly. Moreover, according to that theory, this feature of singularity is essential and universal characteristic of all creatures.<span class="cite">[4]</span> These different theories explain the mysteries of dreams in terms of their correlation with universe. Sleep simulates death, complete nothingness, which generates a new radiation of information, dreams.</p>
                <p><b>Goals and Forms of Project</b><br>
My design project will be expressed based on these findings on dreams and universe. The goal of the project is to help the viewers get a sense of dream generation, and inspire them to reevaluate the effects of dreams on their lives. The form will be an art installation, which has kinetic elements moving according to the interaction with the user. Based on combination of complex, and aesthetic geometric shapes, various movements representing the radiation of dreams will be experienced by audience. The shapes will symbolize “a creation from nothing,” which is the essential, and ironical finding of dreams. Also they will be referred to various geometric shapes presenting elements of universe.</p>
                <p><b>Design Values</b><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Abstract Concept to an Actual Form</span><br>
                            The abstract idea of dreams should be expressed as an actual form in this project. The form should be visible, meaningful, and aesthetic. The sharp concentration on the idea itself through the whole process is essential because it can be easily distracted by some forms from research which actually are not related to the idea.</p></li>
                        <li><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invitation to Calmness</span><br>
                            The users will be invited to experience the artwork one by one. It is a call to rest and calmness. The more a user feel relaxed, the interaction will be more vigorous.</p></li>
                        <li><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Illustration of Nothingness</span><br>
                            The atmosphere of the artwork will be silent, calm, and still. The sense of vacuum and nothingness will be expressed through the visual and interactive elements.</p></li>
                        <li><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A Participant and Audience as the Third Party</span><br>
                            During one user is participating to the actual interaction, the rest of the audience will watch him or her and get the sense by looking at the whole picture. This project is intended to give different values to each party, the value for participants, and the one for the rest of the audience.</p></li>
                        <li><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mesmerizing Movement</span><br>
                            The geometric shapes will be moving according to interaction, and the movement has a meaning of dream creation. The combination of shape and movement will be mesmerizing audience.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p><b>Brain Waves as a Parameter</b><br>	 
For the goal of this project, EEG headset will be used during interaction. EEG headset is made for measuring the user’s brain waves, which can be presented as beta, alpha, delta, theta, and gamma. Beta waves are the frequency range between 14 and 30 Hz, which is generated in awake, normal conscious state. Alpha waves are classified as the range between 9 and 13 Hz, which is appeared in awake, but drowsy state; physically and mentally relaxed. Delta represents deep, dreamless sleep when the frequency is below 4 Hz, and theta is the range of 4 to 8 Hz which means deep meditation, light sleep, and REM sleep. This Theta states can be said as a dream mode. Lastly gamma represents above 30 Hz, which means heightened perception, and often appears when a person get an insight, idea, or creative inspiration.<span class="cite">[5]</span> However, the interesting fact is, if the conscious, this “Aha! Moment,” which is a burst of gamma waves, is preceded by alpha waves. Also there might be the even greater potential of higher gamma waves if delta or theta waves were prior.<span class="cite">[6]</span> Therefore, dreams could be interpreted as one of these “Aha!” moments preceded by delta and theta, which has enormous potential of creativity. This assumption has actually proved by Sean M. Montgomery, Anton Sirota, and Gyorgy Buzsaki, who are in Center for Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience, Rutgers University. They said, “Theta and gamma synchrony (simultaneous occurrence) was significantly higher during REM sleep compared to active waking.”<span class="cite">[7]</span> </p>
                <p><b>Interaction: Simulation of Dream Status</b><br>	 
These studies on brain waves support the idea that dream is the “creation from nothingness.” To simulate dreams for the movement of my installation, using EEG headset can be the right answer. But I figured it would be a better experience when the participant is awake rather than sleep because they can realize the positive effects of dreams in conscious. So it would be a similar setting to measure alpha and gamma instead of theta and gamma. According to the alpha and gamma frequency of the participant, the installation will move. The exhibition setting will be like this: a comfortable, private space will be given to participant, and EEG headset, eye-patch, alarm clock, and simple guideline will be also offered (Figure 1). That guideline leads them to the similar states to dream, which alpha and gamma waves occurred. They cannot see the moves of installation, but the scene will be videotaped and it will be sent to each users if they want. After 5 minutes of experience, participants have opportunity to share their experiences to others. They will be given a card to write or draw their experience (Figure 2), and those will be posted in the board in the exhibition. Sharing is not required so the participants have freedom to reserve their experience on their minds.</p>

                    <h3>Share your experience / Draw your experience</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What did come up your mind?</li>
                        <li>Did any special idea/creativity generated from this experience?</li>
                        <li>Did you enjoy this experience? How?</li>
                    </ul>

                <p><b>Conclusion</b><br>
It is true that not every person enjoys their own dreams, but there is a certain moment of dreams coming unexpectedly from beyond time and space. That moment is the key factor providing vitality of life to people who experienced that. I believe a dream is not disturbing rest, rather it reinforces rest. Through those dreams, people will receive full energy and refreshment for that day. I would like to say a dream is one of the most effective psychotherapy methods. I hope people discover treasures of dreams that they did not realize and have the opportunity to rethink the authentic beauty of dreams through this project. </p>
